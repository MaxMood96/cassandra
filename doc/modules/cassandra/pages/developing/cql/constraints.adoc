= Constraints

Constraints provide a way of specifying and enforcing conditions at a
column level in a table schema definition and enforcing them at write time.

== CREATE CONSTRAINT

Constraints can be created within the column definition, or as part
of the table properties.

The main syntax to define a constraint is as follows:

[source,bnf]
----
CREATE TABLE keyspace.table (
	name text,
	i int CHECK (condition) (AND (condition))*
	...,

);
----

As shown in this syntax, more than one constraint can be defined for a given column using the AND keyword.

== ALTER CONSTRAINT

Altering a constraint is done by following the alter column CQL syntax:
[source,bnf]
----
ALTER TABLE [IF EXISTS] <table> ALTER [IF EXISTS] <column> CHECK <condition>;
----

== DROP CONSTRAINT
And DROP can be used to drop constraints for a column as well.
[source,bnf]
----
ALTER TABLE [IF EXISTS] <table> ALTER [IF EXISTS] <column> DROP CHECK;
----

== AVAILABLE CONSTRAINTS

=== SCALAR CONSTRAINT

Defines a comparator against a numeric type. It support all numeric types supported in Cassandra, with all the regular
comparators.

For example, we can define constraints that ensure that i is bigger or equal than 100 but smaller than 1000.

[source,bnf]
----
CREATE TABLE keyspace.table (
	name text,
	i int CHECK i < 1000 AND i > 100
	...,
);
----

Altering that constraint can be done with:

----
ALTER TABLE keyspace.table ALTER i CHECK i >= 500;
----

Finally, the constraint can be removed:

----
ALTER TABLE keyspace.table ALTER i DROP CHECK;
----

=== LENGTH CONSTRAINT

Defines a condition that checks the length of text or binary type.

For example, we can create a constraint that checks that name can't be longer than 256 characters:

----
CREATE TABLE keyspace.table (
	name text CHECK LENGTH(name) < 256
	...,
);
----

Altering that constraint can be done with:

----
ALTER TABLE keyspace.table ALTER name LENGTH(name) < 512;
----

Finally, the constraint can be removed:

----
ALTER TABLE keyspace.table ALTER name DROP CHECK;
----

=== NOT_NULL constraint

Defines a constraint that checks if a column is not null in every modification statement.

For example, let's have this table:

----
CREATE TABLE ks.tb (
    id int,
    cl int,
    col1 int CHECK NOT_NULL(col1),
    col2 int CHECK NOT_NULL(col2),
    PRIMARY KEY (id, cl)
);
----

then this statement would fail:

----
INSERT INTO ks.tb (id, cl, col1) VALUES (1, 2, 3);
... [Invalid query] message="Column 'col2' has to be specified as part of this query."
----

as well as this statement:

----
INSERT INTO ks.tb (id, cl, col1, col2) VALUES (1, 2, 3, null);
----

A column which has `NOT_NULL` constraint has to be specified in every modification statement.

The constraint can be removed:

----
ALTER TABLE keyspace.table ALTER col1 DROP CHECK;
ALTER TABLE keyspace.table ALTER col2 DROP CHECK;
----

We can not remove the value of a column where `NOT_NULL` constraint is present:

----
DELETE col2 FROM ks.tb WHERE id = 1 AND cl = 2;
... [Invalid query] message="Column 'col2' can not be set to null."
----

Additionally, `NOT_NULL` can not be specified on any column of a primary key,
being it a partition key or a clustering column.
